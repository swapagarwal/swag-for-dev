# Build the development environment:
#   docker build --target base -t devswag-dev . \
#
# Run the development environment:
#   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name devswag-container devswag-dev \
#
# Attach to the running development container:
#   docker attach devswag-container
#
# In this stage, all project files are copied for development.
