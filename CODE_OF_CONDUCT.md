# Code of Conduct

We want to be an open community, and we know Codes of Conduct can be difficult to understand. In light of that, we want to keep our Code of Conduct simple. If we run into issues, this document will be revised.

Our guidelines are as follows:

- Don't be a [jerk](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_jerk).
- Don't spam us or the sites we link to.
- Try to be as PG as possible - our community reaches people of all ages, including young, impressionable people!
